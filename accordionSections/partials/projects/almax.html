            A carousel was used to <strong>save web page space</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The customer wanted as many images in the carousel as possible. However, it was decided any more than
            four images would slow down the website to the point of annoying users who were using a slower
            connection. As a comproimise, I designed the last sliding mage of the carousel, as shown in figure 1,
            as <strong>a link to the gallery page</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            To optimise load times, 480 pixel wide resolution versions of the same image were served to smaller
            screens (480 pixels wide or less). A higher resolution was served to any screen size wider than 480 pixels.
            This was achieved using HTML’s <strong>Responsive Images ‘srcset’ and ‘sizes’ attributes.</strong>

        <p>
            The contact detail icons are web fonts so that, as vectors, their image quality does not deteroriate when
            viewed on larger screens or when the web page zoom is over 100%.
        </p>
        <p>
            Web fonts generally allow for smaller file sizes, compared to rastor images, thereby resulting in a quicker
            download page load time. Also, as they are fonts, unlike images, their CSS can easily be changed.

            Facebook is the most effective way for the company to interact with the public, and wished to draw
            attention to their Facebook presense. The live feed API highlights the company keeps an up to date
            Facebook presense.

            These four sections are descriped in collapsible sections, using Bootstrap's Javascript 'accordion' feature, to save space on the page, especially on mobile device screens.
        </p>
        <p>
            The customer saw the 'References' section as being especially important so on screens above 480 pixels wide this section becomes expanded. On screens above 480px wide there would be a relatively large amount of white space unused if the section were not expanded.

            The '<span class="bold">Gallery of Work</span>' link brings the user to a gallery of previous project work. It uses the <span class="bold">Magnific Popup</span> gallery due to its reliability, compatibility, performance and useability.
